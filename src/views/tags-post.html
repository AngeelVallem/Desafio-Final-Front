<h3>
    Tagging Guidelines
</h3>
<p>
    Tags help people find your post.
Think of tags as the topics or categories that best describe your post.
Add up to four comma-separated tags per post. Combine tags to reach the appropriate subcommunities.
Use existing tags whenever possible.
<br>
Some tags, such as “help” or “healthydebate”, have special posting guidelines.
